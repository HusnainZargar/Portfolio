It is a Demo Portfolio not an Actual Portfolio

Live URL: https://husnainzargar.github.io/Portfolio/

## Overview

This repository contains my **first portfolio project**, a static website built with HTML and CSS to showcase my cybersecurity skills, projects, certifications, and interests. **This is not my final portfolio**—it's a practice project designed to help me develop my web development skills while presenting my journey as an aspiring ethical hacker and cybersecurity student.

The website features a clean, dark-themed design with sections for my background, skills, hands-on projects, certifications, and more. It’s a work in progress and serves as a foundation for future improvements.
